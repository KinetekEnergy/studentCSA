    "## Tools Installation Hack\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Understand the basics of setting up a development environment and the tools required.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shell Commands\n",
    "- `wsl`: Opens a WSL instance\n",
    "- `cd`: Change directory\n",
    "- `git`: Run git commands like pull or push\n",
    "- `apt`: Install, delete, or upgrade apt packages\n",
    "- `brew`: Similar to apt but mainly for Mac\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "- How are the files from GitHub placed on your local machine? How do you navigate to those files?\n",
    "  - Files from GitHub are placed on your local machine by cloning the repository using a `git clone` command, which creates a local copy in a specified directory. You can navigate to these files using your file explorer or terminal.\n",
    "- How are the files updated in GitHub? How do you navigate to those files?\n",
    "  - Files are updated in GitHub by making changes locally, committing them with a `git commit` command, and pushing them back to GitHub using git push. Navigate to these files by accessing your local repository directory.\n",
    "- How would you update your template of the `portfolio_2025` repository? How would you make it more applicable to your specific course?\n",
    "-   To update the `portfolio_2025` repository template, you would customize the content by modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to align with your course. This might involve adding course-specific information, links, or styling relevant to your subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Localhost vs. Deployed Server\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Put into words the difference between viewing GitHub Pages running on your localhost machine versus running on a deployed server.**\n",
    "  - Viewing GitHub Pages on your localhost means you're accessing the website from your local machine, which is typically used for testing and development. Only you can see it at the localhost URL, and others cannot access it. Viewing it on a deployed server like GitHub Pages makes the site publicly accessible, allowing anyone with the URL to view it.\n",
    "  - What is the localhost URL for your project? Can anyone else see what you see?\n",
    "    - The localhost URL is `http://localhost:4000` or `http://127.0.0.1:4000`. No, others cannot see what you see at this URL since it's only accessible from your local machine.\n",
    "  - What is the GitHub Pages URL for your project? Can anyone else see what you see?\n",
    "    - The GitHub Pages URL for your project is typically `kinetekenergy.github.io/studentCSA/`. Yes, anyone with this URL can see the content hosted there, as it's publicly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### DNS and GitHub Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DNS is the address manager for the internet. Reflect on the following questions:**\n",
    "  - Is there a domain on your GitHub Pages?\n",
    "    - Yes, there is a domain on GitHub Pages, typically under the github.io domain, like `kinetekenergy.github.io/studentCSA/`.\n",
    "  - Is the URL for your GitHub Pages different from your neighbors' URLs? Did you change the URL? If so, when?\n",
    "    - Yes, the URL for your GitHub Pages is different from your neighbors' URLs because it's based on your GitHub username and repository name. You can change the URL by configuring a custom domain in the repository settings. This is usually done when you want a personalized or professional domain name, and the change occurs when you set up the custom domain."

    "## Tools Verification Hacks \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Verify that the tools installed are working correctly, and each student can demonstrate an understanding of basic usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Verify Installation\n",
    "It is important that you resolve tool issues immediately. These are the foundations for 24 weeks for CSSE and 36 weeks for CSP and CSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Check Tool Functionality**: Ensure the tools installed in Tools Setup are working correctly using the provided scripts and outputs.\n",
    "- **Run Basic Commands**: Execute basic commands for each tool from the terminal (e.g., `git --version`, `ruby --version`, `python --version`, etc.).\n",
    "  - [Go here and scroll Version Check]({{site.baseurl}}/2024/08/27/Remember-Forever)\n",
    "- **Document Issues and Resolutions**: Record any issues encountered and the strategies and verifications you performed to resolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare for Pair Showcase (Tool Verification)\n",
    "Develop a student view to verify tool installation with the Teacher. You and your pair should share the same validation procedures, but each individual needs to show those procedures running on their personal hardware environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verification Discussion**: Be prepared to discuss outputs from shell scripts during verification.\n",
    "- **Comment Code Cells**: Add comments to code cells to remember and discuss how these verifications work.\n",
    "- **Live Reviews**: Live reviews are subject to Teacher opinion unless you show indisputable command through vocabulary and technical accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Usage with VSCode\n",
    "During the tools and installation process, you are expected to become familiar with VSCode to GitHub operations. By the end of this project, it is expected that you will have a minimum of 5 significant commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perform Basic Operations with GitHub Integration in VSCode\n",
    "Use GitHub with VSCode frequently. Lots of small, iterative commits are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commit**: Save changes to your local repository.\n",
    "- **VSCode Sync (Push)**: Upload your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub.\n",
    "- **Pull**: Download changes from the remote repository to your local repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prepare for Pair Showcase (GitHub)\n",
    "Prepare a 1-minute summary on GitHub Usage. This should focus on GitLens VSCode extension and an interactive overview of the pair's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Show Commits**: Display the history of changes made to the repository using GitLens->Commits.\n",
    "- **Show Contributors**: Highlight the individuals who have contributed to the repository using GitLens->Contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Git**: A distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.\n",
    "- **GitLens**: A powerful extension for VSCode that provides insights into Git repositories. It helps visualize code authorship, track changes, and understand the history and evolution of a codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing these tasks, you will ensure that your development environment is correctly set up and that you are proficient in using essential tools and GitHub integration."

    "**Objective**: Use your tools installation to learn JavaScript, create dynamic web content, and understand that there are many ways to solve the same problem (coding styles).\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Ideation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ideas and hints from the Tool Play lesson, start the ideation process in Jupyter Notebooks to define your future `index.md` home page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideation in the course starts in Jupyter Notebooks. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create an HTML File**: Start with an HTML file that includes a container element.\n",
    "2. **Enhance with CSS**: Use CSS to style your HTML elements.\n",
    "3. **Modify with JavaScript**: Use JavaScript to dynamically modify content within the HTML container.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vocabulary Note**: Modifying an HTML container is often referred to as modifying the DOM (Document Object Model). The term \"DOM\" will be used frequently in the course and is associated with the \"document.\" prefix used in commands like `document.createElement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Update `index.md` Home Page\n",
    "\n",
    "Transition from ideation to designing your own home pages. As you work with your pair, you should learn similar coding styles, but your end product should be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrate JavaScript**: Incorporate your JavaScript code into your GitHub Pages project.\n",
    "2. **Verify Display**: Ensure that the dynamic content is displayed correctly on both localhost and the deployed server.\n",
    "3. **Document Challenges**: Blog about any challenges faced and how you overcame them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare a 2-Minute Summary on Your `index.md`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Demo the Pages**: Show the live pages on both localhost and the deployed server.\n",
    "2. **Show the Code**: Walk through the JavaScript code that modifies the DOM.\n",
    "3. **Jupyter Ideation Process**: Explain the ideation process documented in your Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "4. **Coding Style Question**: Be prepared to answer the question, \"How could you use another coding style to change your loop?\" For example, if you used a `for` loop, explain how you could use `forEach` or another iteration method.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Computers and Terminals\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief overview of Terminal and Linux is a step on your way to becoming a Linux expert. When a computer boots up, **a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started**. This kernel is the core of the operating system and manages hardware resources. Above the kernel, various applications run, including the **shell** and **terminal**, which allow users to interact with the system using a basic set of commands provided by the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, casual users interact with the system through a Desktop User Interface (UI) that is started by the computer's boot-up processes. However, to interact directly with the shell, users can run a \"terminal\" application through the Desktop UI. Additionally, **VS Code provides the ability to activate a \"terminal\"** within its editing environment, making it convenient for developers to execute commands without leaving the code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next phase, we will use a Jupyter notebook to perform Linux commands through a terminal. The Jupyter notebook is an application that runs above the kernel, providing an interactive environment for writing and executing code, including shell commands. This setup allows us to seamlessly integrate code execution, data analysis, and documentation in one place, enhancing our productivity and learning experience.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Nighthawk Pages is a project designed to support students in their Computer Science and Software Engineering education. It offers a wide range of resources including tech talks, code examples, and educational blogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Pages can be customized by the blogger to support computer science learnings as the student works through the pathway of using Javascript, Python/Flask, Java/Spring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Student Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Del Norte HS students will be required to review their personal GitHub Pages at each midterm and final.  This review will contain a compilation of personal work performed within each significant grading period.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Students and Teachers are expected to use GitHub pages to build lessons, complete classroom hacks, perform work on JavaScript games, and serve as a frontend to full-stack applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchange of information could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. sharing a file:  `wget \"raw-link.ipynb\"\n",
    "2. creating a template from this repository\n",
    "3. sharing a fork among team members\n",
    "4. etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is in its 3rd revision (aka 3.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project was initially based on Fastpages. But this project has diverged from those roots into an independent entity.  The decision to separate from Fastpages was influenced by the deprecation of Fastpages by authors.  It is believed by our community that the authors of fastpages turned toward Quatro.  After that change of direction fastpages did not align with the Teacher's goals and student needs. The Nighthawk Pages project has more of a raw development blogging need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### License\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apache license has its roots in Fastpages.  Thus, it carries its license forward.  However, most of the code is likely unrecognizable from those roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Examples**: Provides practical coding examples in JavaScript, including a platformer game, and frontend code for user databases using Python and Java backends.\n",
    "- **Educational Blogs**: Offers instructional content on various topics such as developer tools setup, deployment on AWS, SQL databases, machine learning, and data structures. It utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for interactive lessons and coding challenges.\n",
    "- **Tools and Integrations**: Features GitHub actions for blog publishing, Utterances for blog commenting, local development support via Makefile and scripts, and styling with the Minima Theme and SASS. It also includes a new integration with GitHub Projects and Issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notable Contributions**: Highlights significant contributions to the project, including theme development, search and tagging functionality, GitHub API integration, and the incorporation of GitHub Projects into GitHub pages. Contributors such as Tirth Thakker, Mirza Beg, and Toby Ledder have played crucial roles in these developments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blog Contributions**:  Often students contribute articles and blogs to this project.  Their names are typically listed in the front matter of their contributing post.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub Pages setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The absolutes in setup up...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activate GitHub Pages Actions**: This step involves enabling GitHub Pages Actions for your project. By doing so, your project will be automatically deployed using GitHub Pages Actions, ensuring that your project is always up to date with the latest changes you push to your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the GitHub website for the repository go to the menu: Settings -> Pages ->Build\n",
    "- Under the Deployment location on the page, select \"GitHub Actions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Update `_config.yml`**: You need to modify the `_config.yml` file to reflect your repository's name. This configuration is crucial because it ensures that your project's styling is correctly applied, making your deployed site look as intended rather than unstyled or broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "github_repo: \"portfolio_2025\" \n",
    "baseurl: \"/portfolio_2025\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set Repository Name in Makefile**: Adjust the `REPO_NAME` variable in your Makefile to match your GitHub repository's name. This action facilitates the automatic updating of posts and notebooks on your local development server, improving the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "```make\n",
    "# Configuration, override port with usage: make PORT=4200\n",
    "PORT ?= 4100\n",
    "REPO_NAME ?= portfolio_2025\n",
    "LOG_FILE = /tmp/jekyll$(PORT).log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "All `GitHub Pages` websites are managed on GitHub infrastructure and use GitHub version control.  Each time we change files in GitHub it initiates a GitHub Action, a continuous integration and development toolset, that rebuilds and publishes the site with Jekyll.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- GitHub uses `Jekyll` to transform your markdown and HTML content into static websites and blogs. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).\n",
    "- A Linux shell is required to work with this project integration with GitHub Pages, GitHub and VSCode.  Ubuntu is the preferred shell, though MacOS shell is supported as well.  There will be some key setup scripts that follow in the README.\n",
    "- Visual Studio Code is the Nighthawk Pages author's preferred code editor and extensible development environment.  VSCode has a rich ecosystem of developer extensions that ease working with GitHub Pages, GitHub, and many programming languages.  Setting up VSCode and extensions will be elaborated upon in this document.\n",
    "- An anatomy section in this README will describe GitHub Pages and conventions that are used to organize content and files.  This includes file names, key coding files, metadata tagging of blogs, styling tooling for blogs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensive start. A topic-by-topic guide to getting this project running is published [here](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/portfolio_2025/devops/tools/home).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick start.  A quick start below is a reminder, but is dependent on your knowledge.  Only follow this instruction if you need a refresher.  Always default to the comprehensive start if any problem occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clone Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "Run these commands to obtain the project, then locate into the project directory with the terminal, install an extensive set of tools, and make.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone <this-repo> # git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/portfolio_2025.git \n",
    "cd <repo-dir>/scripts # cd portfolio_2025\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows WSL and/or Ubuntu Users\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execute the script: `./activate_ubuntu.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### macOS Users\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execute the script: `./activate_macos.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kasm Cloud Desktop Users\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execute the script: `./activate.sh`\n",

    "## Run Server on localhost\n",
    "\n",
    "To preview the project you will need to \"make\" the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bundle install\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first time you clone run project you will need to run this Ruby command as the final part of your setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bundle install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start the Server  \n",
    "\n",
    "This requires running terminal commands `make`, `make stop`, `make clean`, or `make convert` to manage the running server.  Logging of details will appear in the terminal.   A `Makefile` has been created in the project to support commands and start processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the server, this is the best choice for initial and iterative development.  Note. after the initial `make`, you should see files automatically refresh in the terminal on VSCode save.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  make\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load web application into the Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the preview server in the terminal,\n",
    "The terminal output from `make` shows the server address. \"Cmd\" or \"Ctl\" click the http location to open the preview server in a browser. Here is an example Server address message, click on the Server address to load:...\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```text\n",
    "  http://0.0.0.0:4100/portfolio_2025/\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regeneration of web application\n",
    "\n",
    "Save on \".ipynb\" or \".md\" file activiates \"regeneration\". An example terminal message is below.  Refresh the browser to see updates after the message displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```text\n",
    "  Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2023-07-31 06:54:32\n",
    "      _notebooks/2024-01-04-cockpit-setup.ipynb\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other \"make\" commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminal messages are generated from background processes.  At any time, click return or enter in a terminal window to obtain a prompt.  Once you have the prompt you can use the terminal as needed for other tasks.  Always return to the root of project `cd ~/vscode/portfolio_2025` for all \"make\" actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop the preview server\n",
    "\n",
    "Stopping the server ends the web server applications running process.  However, it leaves constructed files in the project in a ready state for the next time you run `make`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  make stop\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clean the local web application environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will top the server and \"clean\" all previously constructed files (ie .ipynb -> .md). This is the best choice when renaming files has created duplicates that are visible when previewing work.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  make clean\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observe build errors\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two primary directories for creating blogs.  The \"_posts\" directory is for authoring in markdown only.  The \"_notebooks\" allows for markdown, pythons, javascript and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To name a file, use the following structure (If dates are in the future, review your config.yml setting if you want them to be viewed).  Review these naming conventions.\n",

    "### Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags are used to organize pages by their tag the way to add tags is to add the following to your front matter such as the example seen here `categories: [Tools]` Each item in the same category will be lumped together to be seen easily on the search page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search\n",
    "\n",
    "All pages can be searched for using the built-in search bar. This search bar will search for any word in the title of a page or in the page itself. This allows for easily finding pages and information that you are looking for. However, sometimes this may not be desirable so to hide a page from the search you need to add `search_exclude: true` to the front matter of the page. This will hide the page from appearing when the viewer uses search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation Bar\n",
    "\n",
    "To add pages to the top navigation bar use _config.yml to order and determine which menus you want and how to order them.  Review the_config.yml in this project for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blog Page\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a blog page that has options for images and a description of the page. This page can help the viewer understand what the page is about and what they can expect to find on the page. The way to add images to a page is to have the following front matter `image: /images/file.jpg` and then the name of the image that you want to use. The image must be in the `images` folder. Furthermore, if you would like the file to not show up on the blog page `hide: true` can be added to the front matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SASS support\n",
    "\n",
    "NIGHTHAWK Pages support a variety of different themes that are each overlaid on top of minima. To use each theme, go to the \"_sass/minima/custom-styles.scss\" file and simply comment or uncomment the theme you want to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about the minima themes search for \"GitHub Pages minima\" and review the README.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a new theme search for \"Github Pages Themes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Includes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nighthawk Pages uses liquid syntax to import many common page elements that are present throughout the repository. These common elements are imported from the _includes directory. If you want to add one of these common elements, use liquid syntax to import the desired element to your file. Here’s an example of the liquid syntax used to import: `{% raw %}{%- include post_list.html -%}{% endraw %}` Note that the liquid syntax is surrounded by curly braces and percent signs. This can be used anywhere in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "- To use or create a custom page layout, make an HTML page inside the _layouts directory, and when you want to use that layout in a file, use the following front matter `layout: [your layout here]`.  All layouts will be written in liquid to define the structure of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata, also known as \"front matter\", is a set of key-value pairs that can provide additional information to GitHub Pages about .md and .ipynb files. This can and probably will be used in other file types (ie doc, pdf) if we add them to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the front matter, you can also define things like a title and description for the page.  Additional front matter is defined to place content on the \"Computer Science Lab Notebook\" page.  The `courses:` key will place data on a specific page with the nested `week:` placing data on a specific row on the page.  The `type:` key in \"front matter\" will place the blog under the plans, hacks(ToDo), and tangibles columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In our files, the front matter is defined at the top of the page or the first markdown cell.\n",

    "  - First, open one of the .md or .ipynb files already included in either your _posts|_notebooks folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In the .md file, you should notice something similar to this at the top of the page. To see this in your .ipynb files you will need to double-click the markdown cell at the top of the file.\n",
