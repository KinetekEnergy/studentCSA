[Team Teaches Overview Blog](https://kinetekenergy.github.io/studentCSA/2024/10/09/Overview.html) I wrote an overview notebook with a summary notes page for each lesson taught. I think it will be useful to reference in the future! It will be of great help for me and for when we make our N@TM projects!|\n",

First off, I think we could have easily gotten a better score in the integration if we had ensured everything worked fine. We had issues on the naming conventions and didn't have a navbar, which Mortensen had mentioned us to add. I think the solution would have been talking and consulting with Mr. Mortensen more to clarify any doubts. I think other aspects like my individual contributions are quite solid. However, I do agree that we should have put less hacks in our lesson. I think we should have consolidated the hacks since a lot of them were just stepping stones. We could've combined a lot of hacks.          |\n",

I think people usually only add stuff like their lessons or plans. Personally, I think you should include personal things too. Memories should be fun! They should be times where you were enjoying yourself with your team! For these reasons, I chose to add a couple screenshots of our Slack DMs since I found them funny. I think they were a good memory for me! However, I still added some evidence of the specific lesson that I taught.                   |\n",

I think that often times, most of the team teaches have very dry language. They are so formal, and they don't feel fun. I tried to switch things up by adding a bit of slang and making it less formal while still keeping the important information students need to learn. Our group also used the banana as a pointer, and we made it a reward for the person who answers the most questions. I think that students payed more attention due to this since it was interesting and unique. I tried to also keep everything Minions themed so the presentation would be more engaging to students. I think our presentation was one of the most unique and had a great theme. No other group did what we did, and no other group made a poster (we made a minion poster for the room).        | \n",
