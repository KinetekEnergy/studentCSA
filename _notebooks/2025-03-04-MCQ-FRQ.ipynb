    "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Why the question is wrong:</span> Incorrect. This image would require the second set of nested loops to initialize `row` to `val ‚Äì 1`, increment both `row` and `col` in each iteration inner loop (instead of `row` being decremented) and change the condition on the inner loop to `col &lt; 5 && row &lt; 5`. Essentially, I ran the code backwards and messed up the battens of the diagonals. I misunderstood how the X placement logic works within the nested loop. The loop positions X diagonally whenever the value is odd. It begins at (row = val, col = 0) and moves diagonally downward, ensuring it remains within the boundaries of the 5x5 grid. I accidentally selected an option that didn‚Äôt align with the expected diagonal pattern of X placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">How to improve:</span> As much as paper is discouraged in class, it will be important on the exam because it will help me to keep track of variables. I should trace through the loops and write down what is happening.\n",

    "\n",
    "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Why the question is wrong:</span> Incorrect. References declared of the superclass type can be assigned objects of the subclass. Since there is a `show` method in the superclass a runtime error does not occur. With inheritance we are allowed to override a method from the superclass in the subclass. For some reason, I thought that the function would not be overloaded. I don‚Äôt know why I thought this, but that is not what happens. I thought you needed a key like `@Override` or something similar, but it works normally without anything too.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">How to improve:</span> I should go to previous lessons on classes to remember the topics. It has been a while since I reviewed those topics, so it makes sense that I may have forgotten them.\n",

    "**Q1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the following can be used to replace / *condition* / so that numDivisors will work as intended?\n",

    "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Why the question is wrong:</span> Incorrect. This would be the correct solution if we wanted to know if `k` was evenly divisible by `inputVal`. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and flipped the variables, but that is not what the function is looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">How to improve:</span> One thing I noticed was that College Board uses vaguely named variables and function names with no comments. In real life, you don‚Äôt do that. However, we just have to deal with that here. I think that may be why I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and flipped the variables. Instead, I should try inputting a test value and write down the result to see which answer is correct.\n",
